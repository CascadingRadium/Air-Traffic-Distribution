abstract: >-
  Air traffic management is becoming highly complex with the
  rapid increase in the number of commercial and cargo
  flights,leading to increased traffic congestion and flight
  delays. To mitigate these issues, we present a flight path
  generation system thatdistributes the aeroplanes across
  the airspace and imparts minimal delays to the flight if
  required, thus ensuring that the aircraft followsthe
  shortest route wherein it encounters the least amount of
  traffic. We develop a parallel genetic algorithm in CUDA-C
  with a novelfitness function allowing the system to reach
  an optimal solution where the air traffic density is
  minimised. The proposed algorithmwas tested on one dayâ€™s
  domestic flight schedule and achieved an 18% reduction in
  traffic density, with the flight times and delaysremaining
  proportional to the data observed in the existing air
  traffic management system.
